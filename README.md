# FactoryGigaMod
My huge idea for a brand new scrap mechanic gamemode.

I want to make a huge mod for a new gamemode: Factory!
The Factory gamemode will be a combo on shapez.io, and of course, Scrap Mechanic! You will have to deliver parts to a hub (your delivery sector will do that later in the game), and the parts get more complex. You might start off needing to deliver wooden doors, but at level 50,000 you might need to deliver entire energy-efficient rocket ships! There will be a tutorial, and you can see what you must deliver in the logbook. You can do multiplayer different ways: 

1) Global, Local, and Friends leaderboards
2) Competitive: first to # cash, # level, # net worth or # deliveries
3) One Factory: everyone in that world works on the one factory, as a worker, or manager. Player workers are faster than NPC workers.

The lift with, at first, have NOTHING in it, and creating a blueprint needs cash. In the tutorial, you create a straight, left, and right conveyor belt. You get parts (ie. wood, bearings), make the items via those parts (ie. doors, engines). You start out with 5K cash, and can go in the negatives.
